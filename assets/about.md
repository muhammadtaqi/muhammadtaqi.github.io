I am freelance developer. Currently doing more in backend, focused in Python and Django.

email: agus[at]python.web.id



--- I do Software Engineering [@Ciklum](https://www.ciklum.com/about-ciklum/pakistan/) and there, I am responsible for "keeping the trains running" in our Micro-services Architecture.

--- I work mostly with Python and PHP. Nowadays I am learning Golang.

--- I like simple things that work well. I'm passionate in all that I do. I enjoy building things with a variety of programming languages, stacks and frameworks, teaching and mentoring, and participating in open source software and communities.
