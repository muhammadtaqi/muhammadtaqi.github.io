## 1 - Basic concepts
An object holds the blue print of the class that performs some behavior via methods. The process of creating new objects/instance of class are called initialization. Objects are independent.

- _**Primitive**_ are basic data types that is composed of no other data types and can't be broken down into smaller data types i.e an integer, string etc. It's like `atoms`. While, _**Object**_ can be thought of a `molecule`, consisting of more then one primitive data-types. object also has some default methods of itself, which it inherits from the class object. Primitives are immutable(unchangeable), they can be used as so without any special care. Whereas for objects, special care needs to be taken, they are not immutable by default.

- _**Static vs. dynamic typed programming languages**_ -  In a **statically typed** language, a variable is associated with a type which is known at compile time, and that type remains unchanged throughout the execution of a program. Equivalently, the variable can only be assigned a value which is an instance of the known/specified type. While, In a **dynamically typed** language, a variable has no type, and its value during execution can be anything of any shape and form. Now a days, we introduce static code analysis tools to test our dynamically typed variables before compiling. and also annotation that helps compiler and other tools to understand the type of variables. A dynamically typed language with optional static annotations is also frequently called `gradually typed`. It's a current trend in “scripting” languages that want to offer more static safety or better performance.


- _**Procedural vs object oriented programming**_ -  

  > Both paradigms are simply the approach/modeling of your algorithms and data structures.

  * Procedural -
  * Functional - Algorithms tend also to be defined in terms of recursion and composition rather than loops and iteration.
  * Object Oriented -

    In short and general, Procedural is good for a model that follows a procedure, OOP is good for design, and Functional is good for high level programming.



## 2 - Object Associations
An objects knows about and interacts with another in same fashion.

* Associations
  * _**Bi-directional ( <-----> )**_ -- provides navigational access in both directions, so that you can access the other side without explicit queries. Also it allows you to apply cascading options to both directions.
  * _**Uni-directional (----> or <---- )**_ -- navigational access in one direction only + messages should send from one direction only.
  * _**Association class (drop class)**_ --  no navigational access at all.
* Aggregation
  * Regular aggregation
  * Composition (composite aggregation)
* Generalizations
  * Inheritance
  * Implementation (realization)
* Dependencies


#### Association
* `Inheritance` allows us to define a class that inherits all the attributes and methods of another class.
* `Association` differ from inheritance because rather than passing the methods and properties of a class to another class, they involve instantiating whole objects and using them as properties, or passed-in parameters, in another class.

```php
class A {
  public $b = null;
  public function __construct($object) {
    $this->b = $object
  }
  echo $this->->b->sample_attribute_of_b;
}
```

#### Aggregation and Composition

`Aggregation`

* is a special case of association. When an object 'has-a' another object, then you have got an aggregation between them, also called a "Has-a" relationship.
* the lifecycle of the part is independent of the whole. A single instantiation of Car encapsulates 4 Tire classes. However, Car is passed an existing instantiation of Tire, making it independent from the Car instantiation.
* In aggregation, when a container class is destroyed it doesn't necessarily mean it's aggregate classes are destroyed.

```php
class Tire {}

class Car  
{
    public function __construct(Tire $t1, Tire $2, Tire $t3, Tire $t4)
    {
        $this->tire1 = $t1;
        $this->tire2 = $t2;
        $this->tire3 = $t3;
        $this->tire4 = $t4;
    }
}

$tire1 = new Tire();
$tire2 = new Tire();
$tire3 = new Tire();
$tire4 = new Tire();

$suv = new Car($tire1, $tire2, $tire3, $tire4);
```

`Composition`

* special case of aggregation, a restricted aggregation is called composition. When an object contains the other object, if the contained object cannot exist without the existence of container object, then it is called composition.
* When you insert object of class B into class A. This would let you end up with a composition, since an object of class A can't be created without an object of class B.
* In composition, when a container class is destroyed it results in it's component classes being destroyed as well.

```php
class Lock {}

class Car  
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->lock = new Lock();
    }
}

$suv = new Car();
```

The difference between composition and aggregation is, that an object of a class, which aggregates the objects of another class can exist without those other class objects.

A object of a class, which is a composition of objects of other classes can't exist without the other class objects.


## 3 - Object-Oriented Programming PHP.

### Beginner OOP in PHP

* _**`class`**_ --
* _**`object`**_ --
* _**`interface`**_  --  an contract between caller and calle that who ever implements this interface will have functionality define inside it.
* _**`inheritance`**_  --  allows us to define a class that inherits all the attributes and methods of another class.
  * Rules
    * `is-a` vs. `has-a`
* _**`methods`**_ --
* _**`properties`**_ --
* _**`visible modifiers`**_ -- public, private, protected
* _**`static`**_ -- used when you want to share some info between different objects of the class. as variable is shared each object can update it and the updated value be available for all other objects as well.
* _**`constructor`**_ --


### Intermediate OOP in PHP
* _**`Abstract Class`**_  --   provide functionality to child classes, can't be initialization
* _**`Encapsulation`**_   --   protection of your class and it’s data structure.
* _**`Polymorphism`**_    --   pattern in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface.


* _**Encapsulation**_ --
  Simply, fields of an object/instance should only be read/written by methods of that that object/instance.
  * Rules
    * fields should be kept private.
    * private the methods only used by the class itself.
    * methods which interact with the class from outside the class, make them public

  ![Encapsulation process](/static/post-images/learning-oop-in-php/002.png)
  
```php
<?php
class User
{
    // fields should be kept private
    private $gender;

    // fields should be kept private
    public function getGender() { return $this->gender; }

    public function setGender($gender) { $this->gender = $gender; }
}
// good way
$user = new User();
$user->setGender('male');

// bad way
$user->gender = 'Y';
```

* _**Polymorphism**_ --
  * `Poly` (meaning many) and `morph` (meaning forms). When we start to extend classes, and add functionality to them which wasn’t there previously, and even override existing methods (functions), this is called polymorphism.

```php
<?php
interface Shape {
public function getArea();
}

class Square implements Shape {
private $width;
private $height;

public function __construct($width, $height) {
  $this->width = $width;
  $this->height = $height;
}

public function getArea(){
  return $this->width * $this->height;
}
}

class Circle implements Shape {
private $radius;

public function __construct($radius) {
  $this->radius = $radius;
}

public function getArea(){

  return 3.14 * $this->radius * $this->radius;
}
}

function calculateArea(Shape $shape) {
return $shape->getArea();
}

$square = new Square(5, 5);
$circle = new Circle(7);

echo calculateArea($square), "<br/>";
echo calculateArea($circle);
?>
```

### Advanced OOP in PHP
* _**`Magic Methods`**_ --  predefined function by php compiler which executes on some event i.e `__toString(), __construct()`b.
* _**`Collections`**_ --
* _**`Filtering Collections`**_ --
* _**`SPL Iterator`**_ --
* _**`SPL Count`**_ --
* _**`SPL ArrayAccess`**_ --
* _**`Listener/Observer pattern`**_ --
* _**`MVC`**_ --
* _**`Loose Coupling`**_ --
* _**`High Cohesion`**_ --
